(b) _Woman_

The Queen of Elphin, or Elfhame, is sometimes called the Devil, and it is
often impossible to distinguish between her and the Devil when the latter
appears as a woman. Whether she was the same as the French Reine du Sabbat
is equally difficult to determine. The greater part of the evidence
regarding the woman-devil is from Scotland.

In 1576 Bessie Dunlop's evidence shows that Thom Reid, who was to her what
the Devil was to witches, was under the orders of the Queen of Elfhame:

     'Interrogat, Gif sche neuir askit the questioun at him, Quhairfoir he
     com to hir mair [than] ane vthir bodye? Ansuerit, Remembring hir,
     quhen sche was lyand in child-bed-lair, with ane of her laiddis, that
     ane stout woman com in to hir, and sat doun on the forme besyde hir,
     and askit ane drink at her, and sche gaif hir; quha alsua tauld hir,
     that that barne wald de, and that hir husband suld mend of his
     seiknes. The said Bessie ansuerit, that sche remembrit wele thairof;
     and Thom said, That was the Quene of Elfame his maistres, quha had
     commandit him to wait vpoun hir, and to do hir gude. Confessit and
     fylit.'[119]

In 1588 Alison Peirson 'was conuict for hanting and repairing with the gude
nychtbouris and Quene of Elfame, thir diuers [3]eiris bypast, as scho had
confest be hir depositiounis, declaring that scho could nocht say reddelie
how lang scho wes with thame; and that scho had freindis in that court
quhilk wes of hir awin blude, quha had gude acquentence of the Quene of
Elphane. And that scho saw nocht the Quene thir seuin [3]eir.'[120] In 1597
at Aberdeen Andro Man was accused that

     'thriescoir yeris sensyne or thairby, the Devill, thy maister, come to
     thy motheris hous, in the liknes and scheap of a woman, quhom thow
     callis the Quene of Elphen, and was delyverit of a barne, as apperit
     to the their, thow confessis that be the space of threttie two yeris
     sensyn or thairby, thow begud to have carnall deall with that
     devilische spreit, the Quene of Elphen, on quhom thow begat dyveris
     bairnis, quhom thow hes sene sensyn.... Thow confessis that the
     Devill, thy maister, quhom thow termes Christsonday, and supponis to
     be ane engell, and Goddis godsone, albeit he hes a thraw by God, and
     swyis [sways] to the Quene of Elphen, is rasit be the speaking of the
     word _Benedicite_.... Siclyk, thow affermis that the Quene of Elphen
     hes a grip of all the craft, bot Christsonday is the gudeman, and hes
     all power vnder God.... Vpon the Ruidday in harvest, in this present
     yeir, quhilk fell on a Wedinsday, thow confessis and affermis, thow
     saw Christsonday cum out of the snaw in liknes of a staig, and that
     the Quene of Elphen was their, and vtheris with hir, rydand on quhyt
     haikneyes, and that thay com to the Binhill and the Binlocht, quhair
     thay vse commonlie to convene, and that thay quha convenis with thame
     kissis Christsonday and the Quene of Elphenis airss. Thow affermis
     that the quene is verray plesand, and wilbe auld and young quhen scho
     pleissis; scho mackis any kyng quhom scho pleisis, and lyis with any
     scho lykis'.[121]

Another Aberdeen witch, Marion Grant, was accused in the same year and
confessed, 'that the Devill, thy maister, quhome thow termes Christsonday,
causit the dans sindrie tymes with him and with Our Ladye, quha, as thow
sayes, was a fine woman, cled in a quhyt walicot'.[122] In Ayrshire in 1605
Patrick Lowrie and Jonet Hunter were accused that they 'att Hallowevin
assemblit thame selffis vpon Lowdon-hill, quhair thair appeirit to thame
are devillische Spreit, in liknes of ane woman, and callit hir selff Helen
Mcbrune'.[123] In the Basses-Pyrénées in 1609, one could 'en chasque
village trouuer vne Royne du Sabbat, que Sathan tenoit en delices co[~m]e
vne espouse priuilegiée'.[124] At the witch-mass the worshippers 'luy
baisent la main gauche, tremblans auec mille angoisses, & luy offrent du
pain, des [oe]ufs, & de l'argent: & la Royne du Sabbat les reçoit, laquelle
est assise à son costé gauche, & en sa main gauche elle tient vne paix ou
platine, dans laquelle est grauée l'effigie de Lucifer, laquelle on ne
baise qu'après l'auoir premièrement baisée à elle'.[125] In 1613 the
Lancashire witch, Anne Chattox, made a confused statement as to the sex of
the so-called spirits; it is however quite possible that the confusion is
due to the recorder, who was accustomed to consider all demons as male:
'After their eating, the Deuill called Fancie, and the other Spirit
calling himselfe Tibbe, carried the remnant away: And she sayeth that at
their said Banquet, the said Spirits gaue them light to see what they did,
and that they were both shee Spirites and Diuels.'[126] In 1618 at
Leicester Joan Willimott 'saith, that shee hath a Spirit which shee calleth
Pretty, which was giuen vnto her by William Berry of Langholme in
Rutlandshire, whom she serued three yeares; and that her Master when he
gaue it vnto her, willed her to open her mouth, and hee would blow into her
a Fairy which should doe her good; and that shee opened her mouth, and he
did blow into her mouth; and that presently after his blowing, there came
out of her mouth a Spirit, which stood vpon the ground in the shape and
forme of a Woman, which Spirit did aske of her her Soule, which she then
promised vnto it, being willed thereunto by her Master.'[127] William
Barton was tried in Edinburgh about 1655:

     'One day, says he, going from my own house in Kirkliston, to the
     Queens Ferry, I overtook in Dalmeny Muire, a young Gentlewoman, as to
     appearance beautiful and comely. I drew near to her, but she shunned
     my company, and when I insisted, she became angry and very nyce. Said
     I, we are both going one way, be pleased to accept of a convoy. At
     last after much entreaty she grew better natured, and at length came
     to that Familiarity, that she suffered me to embrace her, and to do
     that which Christian ears ought not to hear of. At this time I parted
     with her very joyful. The next night, she appeared to him in that same
     very place, and after that which should not be named, he became
     sensible, that it was the Devil. Here he renounced his Baptism, and
     gave up himself to her service, and she called him her beloved, and
     gave him this new name of Iohn Baptist, and received the Mark.'[128]

At Forfar in 1662 Marjorie Ritchie 'willingly and friely declared that the
divill appeired to her thrie severall tymes in the similitud of a womane,
the first tyme in on Jonet Barrie's house, the second tyme whyle she was
putting vp lint in the companie of the said Jonet, and that the divill did
take her by the hand at that tyme, and promised that she should never want
money; and therafter that the divill appeired to her in the moiss of
Neutoune of Airly, wher and when she did renunce her baptism'.[129] In 1670
Jean Weir, sister of the notorious Major Weir, gave an account of how she
entered the service of the Devil; the ceremony began as follows: 'When she
keeped a school at Dalkeith, and teached childering, ane tall woman came to
the declarants hous when the childering were there; and that she had, as
appeared to her, ane chyld upon her back, and on or two at her foot; and
that the said woman desyred that the declarant should imploy her to spick
for her to the Queen of Farie, and strik and battle in her behalf with the
said Queen (which was her own words).'[130] Among the Salem witches in
1692, 'this Rampant Hag, Martha Carrier, was the person, of whom the
Confessions of the Witches, and of her own Children among the rest, agreed,
That the Devil had promised her, she should be Queen of Hell.[131]
